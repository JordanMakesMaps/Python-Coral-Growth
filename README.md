## Coral Growth Simulation in Rhino/Grasshopper 

Code and images within the main branch of this repo were originally created by Jasmin Sadegh, Annie-Locke Scherer, and Rebecca Jaroszewski. See [here](http://www.alscherer.com/python-coral-growth-simulation/) for more information.

`coral_growth.py` can be used as a python module with Rhino/Grasshopper to "simulate" branching coral growth. The method of simulation uses [Random Walkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk). Note that this is only meant to mimic the general structure of a branching coral, not the underlying biological mechanism as is done in [Jaap Kandorf's work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1zpsmzsAAAAJ&hl=en). In the figure above you can see conceptually how "branching" occurs with Random Walkers acting as food.

Here is a .gif displaying the original code working in Grasshopper:
